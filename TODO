Games that can be encoded as SMT relatively easily
  Slant
  Towers
  Undead
  Unequal
  Dominosa

Done
  Unruly (Do first)


ALL:

            Interesting to implement
    Flip

        Yes, Known
    Guess:
        Yes, refinement sequence
    Inertia:
        No, Move sequence, also SMT seems bad encoding
    Keen:
        Yes, Known
    Light Up:
        Yes?

        Yes, one cycle issue
    Magnets

    Map:
        Yes, 4 color problem
    Mines
        ??, Would be fun to try to solve it
            Strategy would be to prove things about squares.
            I have the one generic big formula. Every revelation adds constraints
            What question could I ask which would answer the question?
    Mosaic
        Yes?
            Would be fun/easy
    Net
        Yes?
            edge encoding
    Netslide
        No, Move sequence
    Palisade
        Yes? Encoding size of regions
    Pattern
        Yes?
    Pearl
        Yes, single cycle
    Pegs
        No? Move sequence
    Range

    Solo
        Yes
    Tents
        Yes?
